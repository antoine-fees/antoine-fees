Hi, I'm Antoine FEES, first year PhD student in applied semiconductor physics @ONERA Toulouse and @LAAS-CNRS. 
My PhD thesis is about modelling and manuftacturing of multi-junction solar cells for space applications. 
Before that, I graduated as an INSA Toulouse engineer in 2023. 
My favorite subjects are solid state and semiconductor physics, modelling, Âµcontrollers, electronics and instrumentation. 
Feel free to reach me @ fees.antoine@gmail.com for anything relevant.
